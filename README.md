# Description
The heartrate monitoring device is a simple device that can measure the blood oxygen level and the heartrate by simply placing one's finger on the MAX30102 sensor. The data is then collected by the Argon particle device which sends it to the cloud to be processed.

# Installation
To set up and run the project locally, you will need the following:
Hardware
1. Argon particle device
2. Heart Rate Sensor (Module MAX30102 Pulse Detection Blood Oxygen)
3. Micro USB cable for data transfer
4. Mini breadboard
5. Jumper wires

Software
1. Particle IDE or Visual studio code.
2. Particle cloud.


Steps
1. build the circuit using online sources. Usually the argon device comes in a box with the circuit on it.
2. connect argon device to the particle cloud.
3. connect the argon device to your WIFI or Hotspot.
4. Setup an integration in the particle
